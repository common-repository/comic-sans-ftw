# Comic Sans FTW
Happy Comic Sans day! All fans of this awesome font unite on the fourth of July and transform all our websites to use Comic Sans for 24 hours. Now comes with Comic Sans power for your frontend and backend.

Unfortunately, it also changes the font of a lot of the icons, which renders them useless, but you get Comic Sans in return.
